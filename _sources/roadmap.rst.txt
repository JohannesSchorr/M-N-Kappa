Roadmap
=======
- Implementation of :math:`M`-:math:`N`-:math:`\kappa` for single-span beams

  - add computation of :math:`M`-:math:`N`-:math:`\kappa`-curves
  - add computation of deformation using slip, shear-connectors and :math:`M`-:math:`N`-:math:`\kappa`-curve

- Implementation of :math:`M`-:math:`\kappa` for multi-span beams
- Implementation of :math:`M`-:math:`N`-:math:`\kappa`-curves for multi-span beams

Ideas
=====
These are rough ideas where the procedure is not yet clear.
Furthermore, it is unclear if these ideas are going to be applied at all.

- computation of the moment-curvature-relationship in two directions perpendicular to each other
  (interesting for
- computation of columns using the :math:`M`-:math:`N`-:math:`\kappa`-method
- considering loading-history
- consider creep and shrinkage
