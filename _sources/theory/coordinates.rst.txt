   User's guide - coordinates: Draw figure

The beam starts at the location of one support and ends in case of a single-span beam at the other support.
The corresponding coordinate is X.

The Y-Axis is the horizontal axis perpendicular to the X-axis.

The vertical Z-axis is defined from top to bottom.
Therefore, it is recommended to define the origin at the top-edge of the cross-section.
