   Axes

The `cartesian coordinate system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system>`_
is used for describing the geometric instances of a beam.

The beam starts at the location of one support and ends in case of a single-span beam at the other support.
The corresponding axis is the X-axis.

The Y-axis is the horizontal axis perpendicular to the X-axis.

The vertical Z-axis is defined from top to bottom.

Therefore, it is recommended to define the origin at the top-edge of the cross-section.
