Coordinates
***********

The beam starts at the location of one support and ends in case of a single-span beam at the other support.
The corresponding coordinate is X.

The vertical axis is defined from top to bottom.
Therefore, it is recommended to define the origin at the top-edge of the cross-section.
The top-edge is defined by the top-edge of the concrete slab in this example.
If needed it is called the Y-axis.

The Z-axis is perpendicular to the X- and the Y-axis.
Meaning the horizontal axis perpendicular to the axis along the beam.
