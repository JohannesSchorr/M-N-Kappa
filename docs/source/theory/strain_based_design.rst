Introduction
============

:ref:`theory_sections` indicates how axial force and moment are computed for a :ref:`theory_sections_sections` and
:ref:`theory_sections_cross_sections` under a given strain-distribution.


.. _theory_strain_based_design_aim:

Aim
===

The aim is to find a distribution of strains over a beam cross-section leading to an equilibrium of the horizontal forces
:math:`H` (see Formula :math:numref:`eq:theory_strain_based_design_equilibrium`).
In consequence the summarized axial forces of all sub-sections :math:`N_i` must become zero.

.. math::
   :label: eq:theory_strain_based_design_equilibrium

   H = \sum N_i = 0

The strain-distribution leading to equilibrium of the axial-forces is found by iteration.
